DNSRunner
=========

DNS Enumeration, the python way.

OK, This is my first project in the open source community so... :)

this project is much like Rsnake's grate project Fierce but with some improvements.

the main issue that had me started this project is that i needed to use fierce over an ssh tunnel but i didn't found a way to tell fierce to use TCP instead of UDP.
i didn't built the socks support in this tool but you can use proxychains or proxifier.


this tool can work on public networks but i am going to focus it on internal networks.
